### Introduction
It is a high-performance causal inference (statistical model) computing 
library based on OLAP, which solves the performance bottleneck of the existing 
statistical model library (R/Python) under big data. At the same time, 
the threshold for using statistical models is lowered through the SQL language, 
making it easy to use in production environments.
